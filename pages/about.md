## About the Collection
This is a collection of photographs to showcase my work from 2015 onwards. You can find more at [samanthaobman.com](https://samanthaobman.com/).

## About Me
I am a photographic artist and aspiring archivist originally from Iowa but currently living in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Much of my work and research surrounds the domestic space, the Midwest, and ritual. Feel free to get in touch via [my website!](https://samanthaobman.com/contact/)
